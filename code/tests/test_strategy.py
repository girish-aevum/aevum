Comprehensive Test Coverage Improvement Strategy

Goals:
1. Increase overall test coverage to 80%+
2. Ensure critical paths are thoroughly tested
3. Implement both unit and integration tests

Test Coverage Improvement Checklist:

A. Core Testing Principles:
- Test positive scenarios
- Test negative scenarios
- Test edge cases
- Test error handling
- Test performance-critical paths

B. Module-Specific Testing Strategies:

1. Authentication Module:
- Test user registration workflows
- Test password reset mechanisms
- Test authentication endpoints
- Test user profile management
- Test subscription-related flows

2. AI Companion Module:
- Test chat generation workflows
- Test message reaction mechanisms
- Test QA review processes
- Test thread management
- Test AI response generation

3. DNA Profile Module:
- Test DNA kit ordering process
- Test PDF processing
- Test consent management
- Test genetic data handling

4. Mental Wellness Module:
- Test mood tracking
- Test intervention recommendations
- Test data privacy and security

5. Performance Testing:
- Benchmark API response times
- Test concurrent user scenarios
- Measure resource utilization

C. Cross-Cutting Concerns:
- Validate input sanitization
- Test rate limiting
- Verify error logging
- Check permission enforcement

D. Security Testing:
- Test authentication bypass attempts
- Validate input validation
- Check for potential SQL injection
- Test token management

E. Compliance and Data Integrity:
- Verify GDPR compliance checks
- Test data anonymization
- Validate data retention policies

Recommended Testing Tools:
- pytest for unit and integration tests
- coverage.py for test coverage analysis
- locust for performance testing
- hypothesis for property-based testing

Implementation Phases:
1. Identify untested code paths
2. Write targeted test cases
3. Run coverage analysis
4. Iterate and improve

Metrics for Success:
- Overall coverage > 80%
- No critical paths with <70% coverage
- All high-risk modules thoroughly tested
